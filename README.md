From this analysis we found that while there were only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "plays" category is the most successful.

From this analysis we can observe that the most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other hand, December doesn't seem like a great time to launch a campaign.

From this statistical analysis we can observe that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. Louise is asking for more than twice the average successful Kickstarter goal, so this isn't great news for her campaign. In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects.

## Conclusion

From this analysis, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000 in UK. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so Louise should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged. Louise should also try to launch her campaign in May in UK and try to get per play produced for £2,000 to be successful.
